# KW11-More-Complicated-Notepad5000

## Description

This app is a web-based note taking app! I'm constantly wanting to take notes in class, and now this will help me keep them more organized than my private slack chat can. 

## Installation

To install the web server for this app you'll open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of the app, type "npm i" to install the packages, then once that's finished you'll type "node server" to start up the server.

## Usage

Here's the link to More-Complicated-Notepad5000! [MCN5000](https://kw11-more-complicated-notepad5000.onrender.com/)

To use this app you'll navigate to the main page (if you're using it locally, it'll be set to http://localhost:3001 by default unless you change it) and click "Get Started". This takes you to the notes page, where you'll see a space to enter a note Title on the right side of the page, and a note textbody under that. Once you're satisfied with your title and text, you can click save note in the top right corner, and see your note appear on the left hand side of the page. If you ever want to go back to a previous note all you have to do is click on it in the sidebar on the left, then it appears on the note writing space on the right. If you want to delete a note, just click the red delete button next to the note you want to delete.
